\section{Summary and conclusion}
At the end, we have successfully produced a demo unit that could be implemented and scaled. On top of that, it is modular.

The database structure can scale as needed. For the company that is starting up, it wold make sense from financial standpoint to just use 1 shard instead of 3 that we have implemented. That is the great thing about NoSQL, it is simple to scale vertically or horizontally! This is specially possible with Docker. We can deploy, start/stop containers as we need.

User interface is modular as well. For our use, we have implemented NodeJS with combination of express, handlebars and mongoose. But since JavaScript is popular, this can be replaced with anything else! At the end of the day, we could use Flask (Python) with Bootstrap.

At the moment, there are still improvements that can be made. The improvements are more from technical side and range from "nice to have" to "necessary" ones. List of improvements can be found under appendix A2-improvements.
