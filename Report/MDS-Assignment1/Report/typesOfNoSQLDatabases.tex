\section{Types of NoSQL databases}

NoSQL stands for not structured SQL. Since there is no structure, a lot of companies have created NoSQL management system in different ways. All of them are trying to achieve the same goal of efficiency and uptime but with different approaches \parencite{web:Hackolade}. Here are some of more well known and used approaches:
\begin{itemize}
  \item NoSQL Document
  \begin{itemize}
      \item basic unit of data is "Document", we would call that Row in SQL,
      \item document is ordered set of key-value pairs,
      \item are schema free,
      \item represented simple structure is: database, collection (or table in SQL), document.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item NoSQL Columnar
  \begin{itemize}
      \item data is stored with column oriented model,
      \item uses keyspace model which is similar to schema in relational databases,
      \item represented simple structure is: keyspace, column family, rows, columns.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item NoSQL Property Graph
  \begin{itemize}
      \item organises data in graph represented structure,
      \item is made of nodes (represents an entity) and edges (represents connection/relationships between two nodes).
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item NoSQL Key-Value
  \begin{itemize}
      \item every item is stored as key-value,
      \item data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs,
      \item key must be unique.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item NoSQL Multi-model
  \begin{itemize}
      \item joins the previous NoSQL types (Document, Graph, Key-Value) together,
      \item instead of using 3 different NoSQL types in a project, 1 multi-model can be used to provide the same functionality.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
